# Mirror Exposure Gaze Analyzer
This repository shows an implementation for analyzing gaze behavior of a person in a mirror exposure task. This tool allows to define visual bounding boxes derived from measured body data on a mirror image of a person. Together with gaze data from pupil lab eye trackers, it is then possible to analyze gaze behavior. The repository provides the code to the paper: link and includes the sample implementation for the study at that time with the Areas of Interest: head, left hand, right hand, and feet. For more information please read the paper.

## Getting started
- Install all required python packages (see requirements.txt) -> pip install -r requirements.txt
- Start the pipeline by starting the `AoI_creator.py` script. 
- See Results in the Results folder afterwards

## Changing Areas of Interest or the Environment 
- Exact documentation will follow. There are some hints in the code where to edit values.
